This poster gives an overview of all publicly available Upper and Lower Sorbian language technology resources, shown from the perspective of an end user. 

In order to preserve areas where Sorbian can be spoken to a mixed German and Sorbian audience, creating a simultaneous translation from Sorbian to German is one of our core tasks.

In order to create such a system, we need to work on the individual building blocks first. The poster shows achievements at each of these three blocks speech recognition, machine translation and speech synthesis. Furthermore, results from relevant fundamental research are included. 

Most of the technology and knowledge is publicly availabe. We value every contribution to these systems.
